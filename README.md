üìÅ Project Structure:
Created a folder with these files:
‚Ä¢ variable.tf, provider.tf, vpc.tf, securitygroup.tf, keypair.tf, InstanceID.tf, Instance.tf, web.sh, and backend.tf.
üõ†Ô∏è Key Highlights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ variable.tf
‚Ä¢ Defined variables like AWS region, availability zones, and SSH user (webuser).
2Ô∏è‚É£ vpc.tf
‚Ä¢ Created a VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
‚Ä¢ Set up 2 public subnets (10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16) in AZ1 & AZ2
‚Ä¢ Added an Internet Gateway, public route table (0.0.0.0/0), and associated the public subnets
3Ô∏è‚É£ provider.tf
‚Ä¢ Configured AWS provider and region
4Ô∏è‚É£ securitygroup.tf
‚Ä¢ Allowed inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP)
‚Ä¢ Enabled outbound access to the internet
5Ô∏è‚É£ keypair.tf
‚Ä¢ Generated a secure SSH key pair using ssh-keygen
‚Ä¢ Used aws_key_pair resource in Terraform to associate with EC2
6Ô∏è‚É£ InstanceID.tf
‚Ä¢ Used the data "aws_ami" block to dynamically fetch the latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI
‚Ä¢ Added an output block to expose and verify the selected AMI ID
7Ô∏è‚É£ Instance.tf
‚Ä¢ Provisioned an EC2 instance in a public subnet using the above AMI
‚Ä¢ Attached the created security group and key pair
‚Ä¢ Used Terraform provisioner "file" to upload a script (web.sh) into the instance
‚Ä¢ Configured connection block to securely SSH into the instance via Terraform
‚Ä¢ Executed the script remotely using provisioner "remote-exec" to:
o Install Apache (httpd)
o Serve a basic webpage from /var/www/html
8Ô∏è‚É£ backend.tf
‚Ä¢ Configured backend "s3" block to store the Terraform state file in an S3 bucket
‚Ä¢ This allows collaboration, locking, and safer state management for team-based work
